Implicit wait is a global setting that applies to all elements in a Selenium script.
It tells the web driver to wait for a certain amount of time before throwing an exception if the element is not found.

Explicit wait is a more flexible wait that allows us to wait for a specific condition to be met
before continuing test execution. We can define the condition, such as the presence or absence of an element,
using the ExpectedConditions class. An exception is thrown if the condition is not met within the specified time.

differences:
The main difference between implicit wait and explicit wait is that implicit wait applies to all elements,
while explicit wait applies to a specific element or condition. Implicit wait is easier to use,
but it may cause unnecessary waiting or miss some elements that load later.
Explicit wait is more precise, but it requires more code and may cause performance issues if used too frequently.
